//Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged because his little brother is better than him.

//Write a program where Alex can input (n) how many times the hoop goes round and it will return him an encouraging message:

//if Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string "Great, now move on to tricks".
//If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string "Keep at it until you get it".



//my solution

function hoopCount (n) {
  //return encouraging message
  //10 > hoops return string "Great, now move on to tricks"
 if (n >= 10) {
   return "Great, now move on to tricks"
 } else {
    //10 < hoops return string "Keep at it until you get it"
   return "Keep at it until you get it"
 }
}
